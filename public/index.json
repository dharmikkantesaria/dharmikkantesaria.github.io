I was fascinated by how a military experiment from the 1980s had evolved into an integral part of our daily lives. From that moment on, I was determined to explore and contribute to the field of cybersecurity, driven by the ever-growing need to secure data in our increasingly digital world.\nSince then, I\u0026rsquo;ve been on a continuous path of learning and skill development. I am currently preparing for Splunk Certified Power User and Azure Security Engineer Associate certifications. Through academic coursework, personal projects, and professional experiences, I\u0026rsquo;ve honed my abilities and deepened my understanding of this perpetual and dynamic field.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always eager to discuss trends in the cybersecurity industry, collaborate on projects, or explore new opportunities.

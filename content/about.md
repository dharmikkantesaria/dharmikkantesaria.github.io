Hi, I'm Dharmik Ashwin Kantesaria, a passionate cybersecurity professional based in the United States. With a Masters in Cybersecurity and a strong background in Computer Science, I thrive on tackling new challenges and experimenting with cutting-edge solutions. My expertise spans Network Security, Security Testing & Assessment, and Security Automation. 

### My Journey

My cybersecurity journey began during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science. A pivotal moment came in my 4th semester when I attended an Ethical Hacking workshop at BITS, Hyderabad. This eye-opening experience introduced me to the fundamental concepts of computer networking and security, providing a glimpse into the world of real-world hacking and vulnerability exploitation.

This workshop made me realise the natural passion I have for cybersecurity, which was further fueled by my subsequent semester's study of computer networks. I was fascinated by how a military experiment from the 1980s had evolved into an integral part of our daily lives. From that moment on, I was determined to explore and contribute to the field of cybersecurity, driven by the ever-growing need to secure data in our increasingly digital world.

Since then, I've been on a continuous path of learning and skill development. I am currently preparing for Splunk Certified Power User and Azure Security Engineer Associate certifications. Through academic coursework, personal projects, and professional experiences, I've honed my abilities and deepened my understanding of this perpetual and dynamic field.

I'm always eager to discuss trends in the cybersecurity industry, collaborate on projects, or explore new opportunities. Whether you're a fellow professional, a potential collaborator, or just someone interested in cybersecurity, I'd love to connect.

**Together, let's work towards building a more secure digital world!**
